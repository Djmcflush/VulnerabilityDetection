## About this project

Very Simple app for Detecting Vulnerabilities in smart contracts
**This is not a starter template.**

A few people have asked me to turn this into a starter. I think we could do that once the new features are out of beta.

```sh

```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the variables.
